# python-workshop-2020

## Intro
Welcome to the "Introduction to Programming, Web Scraping, and Data Cleaning in Python"! The goal of this workshop is to increase data fluency of the Brown community. In the first two weeks of the workshop, we learn Python basics. In the third week, we use web scraping to collect data from the web. Web scraping allows us to automate data collection from websites of varying underlying formats. In the fourth week, attendees learn to clean and process the scraped data using the pandas library.

The live workshop runs for four weeks four hours a day. We have a two hour lecture and a two hour lab session to practice coding. 

This readme file contains links to the daily materials and recordings.

## Tools
We use JupyterHub during the workshop. The Brown JupyterHub is designed to provide an environment to run Jupyter Notebooks for Python, Julia, R, and other languages without the need to install any software or packages. JupyterHub is interacted with completely through a web browser. This service is a collaboration supported by various teams in CIS. To learn more about the hub, please check out the documentation [here](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/jupyterhub/).
