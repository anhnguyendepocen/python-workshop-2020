    "Clean the genres column in imdb.csv. One movie could belong to multiple genres. For example, the genre of the first movie (Get Paid, Get Laid & Get Lucky) is \"Crime, Drama, Romance\". This is one string. Ideally you'd like to split this string into three parts \"Crime\", \"Drama\", and \"Romance\". The primary genre of the movis is 'Crime', the secondary genre is 'Drama', and the third genre is 'Romance'. You should store these three values in three different columns named something like genre 1, genre 2, genre 3. \n",
